# 💻 Professional Experience

## Intelligent family tree community

🔥 The possibility of LLM collaboration with humanities and history studies is now being explored! [try our demo!](http://nenva.com:2333/)

The face recognition technology is used to collect personnel information from group photos, and the tags are combined to associate family social relationships and analyze social networks, so as to realize the visual derivation of community and family tree. Build a end-to-end social/historical humanities research platform.

[RESEARCH ON THE TRANSFORMATION OF HISTORIC PATTERNS OF OLD SUMMER RESORTS USING SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS: A CASE STUDY OF KULIANG IN FUZHOU, CHINA](https://doi.org/10.5194/isprs-archives-XLVIII-M-2-2023-927-2023)

**Y. N. Lin, C. Yang, Y. X. Chen, Y. F. Bu, C. L. Ping, and B. Y. Cheng**
- The seemingly randomized distribution of buildings and historical landscapes in Kuliang is a result of social relationship development.
- The formation of Kuliang's summer resort is correlated with the selection of "central members" in the community and has distinct temporal characteristics.
- Information technology has great potential for the analysis of the formation process of cultural landscapes. These research findings provide important reference for the protection of cultural heritage and understanding the role of social relationships in shaping cultural landscapes.

# 🏢 Internships
## China Innovation Center of Roche

*AI Development Intern of the AIDD (Artificial Intelligence, Data and Digital) Dep.*

[Certification](pdf/roche.pdf)

- Assisted in developing the AI-based Chemical PAtent recognitioN with Digital Automation (cPANDA) system that utilises computer vision technologies to extract and identify chemical formulas from patent data and realize the digitization and automation of preliminary research
- Fully engaged in the back-end development for the cPANDA system's implementation workflow which involved the segmentation/recognition of chemical structure molecular formulas in PDF images, the extraction of fingerprints for nearly 2000 molecular formulas, and the dimension reduction/clustering/visualization of data.
- Built (with Redis and Celery) a concurrent system containing 7 workers and 5 queues/priority queues on the Linux server to achieve fair allocation and scheduling of task resources under high concurrency conditions
- Encapsulated PyTorch and its essential CUDA environment with docker containers to simplify the migration between platforms
- Used the PostgreSQL database to manage the massive structural molecular data extracted from patents, providing data support for subsequent machine learning statistical analysis.

## Continental Automotive Systems (Shanghai) Co., Ltd

*Software Intern*

[Certification](pdf/continental.pdf)

-	Researched speech recognition datasets for academic use, tested them on the platforms of major voice service providers (such as Google, Azure and ByteDance) as well as some open source speech recognition projects (such as Whisper and PaddleSpeech), and produced reports on their character error rates (WER) and character error rates (CER)
-	Screened out suitable speech recognition/speech synthesis service providers (online and offline) and developed the demo of a voice-based intelligent Q&A assistant by integrating large language models (LLM) like ChatGPT, ChatGLM and Alpaca
-	Investigated the practical applications of the LLM models ChatGPT/ChatGLM/Alpaca and built up a local repository-based natural language document Q&A tool through the Prompt Engineering lang chain
