# üíª Projects

## Intelligent family tree community

üî• The possibility of LLM collaboration with humanities and history studies is now being explored! [try our demo!](http://nenva.com:2333/)

The face recognition technology is used to collect personnel information from group photos, and the tags are combined to associate family social relationships and analyze social networks, so as to realize the visual derivation of community and family tree. Build a end-to-end social/historical humanities research platform.
